## Mnesia-Specific Considerations

### Table Design Strategy
```erlang
% Example table definitions:
:create_table(users, [
  {attributes, [:username, :email, :password_hash, :inserted_at, :updated_at]},
  {disc_copies, [node()]},
  {type, set},
  {index, [:email]}
])

:create_table(packages, [
  {attributes, [:name, :repository_name, :meta, :downloads, :inserted_at, :updated_at]},
  {disc_copies, [node()]},
  {type, set},
  {index, [:repository_name]}
])
```

### Data Partitioning Strategy
1. **Hot data**: RAM-only tables for frequent queries
2. **Warm data**: RAM + disk copies for balance
3. **Cold data**: Disk-only tables for archival

### Query Optimization
1. **Primary keys**: Use package names as keys for direct access
2. **Secondary indices**: Email, repository name, version
3. **Pattern matching**: Leverage Erlang pattern matching for queries
4. **Aggregation**: Use Mnesia counters for download statistics

### Transaction Handling
1. **Atomic operations**: Use Mnesia transactions for consistency
2. **Conflict resolution**: Implement application-level conflict resolution
3. **Deadlock prevention**: Use proper transaction ordering
4. **Performance**: Batch operations where possible

**Storage**: Mnesia for all data, File storage for packages/docs
**Clustering**: Erlang distribution for Mnesia clustering
**Monitoring**: LiveDashboard, Telemetry, Mnesia-specific metrics
**Deployment**: Docker with persistent volumes, Kubernetes StatefulSets

## Migration Strategy from Ecto

Since this is a greenfield project, no actual migration needed, but:
1. Remove Ecto/PostgreSQL dependencies from mix.exs
2. Add :mnesia to extra_applications
3. Update configuration to use Mnesia
4. Create Mnesia initialization on application start
